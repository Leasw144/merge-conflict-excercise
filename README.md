I look around and Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey

<!-- hey Linus this is an other song by the same artist -->

[Verse]
Take off my disguise
I'm living someone else's life
Suppressing who I was inside
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky
Together we're alone (Together we're alone)
In Vegas, I feel so at home (In Vegas, I feel so at home)
I'm falling only for the night
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky (The sky)
Oh, oh, oh, how much to light up my star again
And rewire all my thoughts?
Oh, baby, won't you remind me what I am
And break, break my little cold heart?
